# Core App Generation Task Breakdown

## Foundational Setup
- Establish project structure with distinct core, processing, UI, and plugin layers to preserve modular boundaries outlined in the design document.
- Implement application bootstrap (`AppCore`) that wires logging, settings persistence, module discovery, and thread infrastructure from the outset.
- Configure centralized logging with rotating files, developer diagnostics toggles, and anonymized log formatting.
- Create a unified settings manager leveraging `QSettings`, including JSON import/export handlers for reproducible configurations.

## Processing and Pipeline Management
- Implement the pipeline manager capable of ordering transformations, toggling modules, and recording undo/redo history.
- Build asynchronous thread controller utilities (e.g., based on `ThreadPoolExecutor`) that expose progress/cancellation signals to the UI.
- Define module base classes and registration contracts that future preprocessing, segmentation, and analysis modules will follow.

## User Interface Foundations
- Scaffold a PyQt main window with dockable panels, status bar, and DPI-aware layout behavior.
- Introduce menu structure (File, Edit, View, Modules, Help) with shortcuts and context menus wired to core actions.
- Implement non-blocking dialogs for parameter adjustment with real-time preview capabilities and comprehensive tooltips.

## Data Handling and Persistence
- Establish image I/O utilities supporting PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, and NPY formats while preserving metadata.
- Implement autosave, backup-before-overwrite, and JSON sidecar creation for reproducibility.
- Ensure pipeline states and intermediate results are cached and retrievable for undo/redo and reproducibility.

## Accessibility and Localization
- Add high-contrast themes, scalable icons/fonts, and full keyboard navigation support at the UI level.
- Prepare Qt translation hooks and language pack loading workflows.
- Enforce tooltip coverage for all user-adjustable inputs, including recommended value ranges.

## Reliability, Security, and Diagnostics
- Integrate error dialogs with contextual tracebacks and safe failure paths for module isolation.
- Create diagnostics panel for log viewing and thread monitoring within the app.
- Implement crash recovery routines, isolated temp directories, and strict input sanitization for user-supplied files.

## Performance and Extensibility Enhancements
- Optimize data pipelines using in-place NumPy operations, caching, and optional GPU hooks.
- Design plugin discovery in `/modules` directory via `importlib`, enabling runtime extension and safe fallback for missing modules.
- Build version metadata handling, update checker stubs, and telemetry toggles limited to explicit debug mode.

## Next-Step Iterations
- Add comprehensive testing around pipeline execution, settings round-trips, and module failure isolation.
- Prepare developer documentation covering module authoring guidelines, logging conventions, and UI accessibility standards.
- Plan for future GPU acceleration pathways and integration of OpenCV/scikit-image optimizations within processing modules.
